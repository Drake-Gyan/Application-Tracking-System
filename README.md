# About The Project - 
The provided code presents a Streamlit application designed to enhance the resume evaluation process through the integration of Google's Generative AI technology. Aptly titled "ATS Tracking System," the application serves as a sophisticated tool for Human Resource professionals and job seekers alike. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, it offers insightful analysis and assessment of resumes against specific job descriptions.

Upon accessing the application, users are greeted with a user-friendly interface, inviting them to input job descriptions and upload resumes in PDF format. Through seamless integration with Google's Generative AI model, the system swiftly processes uploaded resumes, extracting key information and generating comprehensive evaluations.

The core functionality revolves around two primary actions triggered by user inputs: "Tell Me About the Resume" and "Percentage match." The former prompts the system to provide detailed insights into the alignment between the uploaded resume and the specified job description, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the candidate. Meanwhile, the latter action calculates the percentage match between the resume and the job requirements, providing additional analysis on missing keywords and offering concluding thoughts.

Powered by advanced AI capabilities, this application streamlines the resume evaluation process, empowering HR professionals to make informed decisions and assisting job seekers in optimizing their resumes for better opportunities. With its intuitive interface and cutting-edge technology, the ATS Tracking System represents a significant advancement in recruitment and career development strategies.
